Multi-workshop website
======================

This branch contains per-workshop websites for several workshops, as
well as an index with a list of all per-workshop websites.  We keep
track of the workshop websites using `git submodule` to maintain local
checkouts of each workshop's website branch.

Add a new workshop
------------------

Check out that workshops website branch into a subdirectory:

  $ git submodule add -b 2012-10-caltech.jekyll git://github.com/wking/swc-workshop.git 2012-10-caltech

`git submodule` does not seem to have been designed with this kind of
local aggregation in mind, and neither has [GitHub's Pages
generator][pages-submodule].

After creating the submodule, add a link from `index.md`, preferably
in alphabetical order.  Finally, commit your changes:

  $ git commit -am '2012-10-caltech: add workshop submodule.'

Setting up submodules on a new checkout
---------------------------------------

When you checkout this branch, it will just have a `.gitmodules` file
and empty module directories.  To initialize the submodule metadata
and checkout the submodule content, you'll need to run:

  $ git submodule update --init

Maintain workshops
------------------

You can pull current versions of each submodule with:

  $ git submodule foreach '(git checkout XXX && git pull)'

Then commit your changes:

  $ git commit -am 'Update all submodules to current HEADs.'

(todo: branch to checkout)
