Multi-workshop website
======================

This branch contains per-workshop websites for several workshops, as
well as an index with a list of all per-workshop websites.  We keep
track of the workshop websites using `git submodule` to maintain local
checkouts of each workshop's website branch.

Add a new workshop
------------------

Check out that workshops website branch into a subdirectory:

  $ git submodule add -b 2012-10-caltech.jekyll ./ 2012-10-caltech

..  $ git submodule add -b 2012-10-caltech.jekyll --reference ./ ./ 2012-10-caltech

`git submodule` does not seem to have been designed with this kind of
local aggregation in mind, so it converts `./` to your public
(upstream) repository and fetches the remote branch from there.  This
means that the `2012-10-caltech.jekyll` branch must already be in your
public repo.  You'll also want to edit
`.git/modules/2012-10-caltech/config` to have

  [remote "origin"]
    url = ./

I'll work on getting these fixed upstream.

After creating the submodule, add a link from `index.md`, preferably
in alphabetical order.

Maintain workshops
------------------

You can pull current versions of each submodule with:

  $ git submodule foreach git pull

(todo: submodule init, checkout before pull?)
