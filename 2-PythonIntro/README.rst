Python
======

`Python <http://www.python.org>`_ is a programming language gaining popularity
in the sciences. It's open source, free, and an array of existing libraries
mean you can often find code that will do some task for you.

Python is also used outside science and engineering as a general scripting
language, on the web, and powering desktop applications. There is a large,
global community of Python users across many disciplines, making it a useful
language to know when your work starts to intersect with that of others
outside your lab or team.

================
IPython Notebook
================

The Introduction to Python tutorial will be taught using the
`IPython <http://ipython.org>`_ notebook.

Launching the IPython Notebook
------------------------------

1. At the command line, `cd` to the `2-PythonIntro` directory.
2. Type `ipython notebook`.

 - This should open a new tab in a web browser. (We suggest Firefox.)
 - You should see a list of existing notebooks in the `2-PythonIntro`
   directory. Clicking on one will open it in a new tab.

3. Click the `Exercises` notebook to open it in a new tab. This contains the
   exercises you will work on today.
4. Go back to the first tab opened by ipython and click the 'New Notebook'
   button. You can use this notebook as your scratch pad today. Feel free
   to rename and save it.

IPython Notebook Commands
-------------------------

- `shift-Enter`: run the current cell
- `control-m h`: show keyboard shortcuts
- `control-m m`: convert cell to a text cell
- `control-m c`: convert cell to a code cell
- `control-m d`: delete cell
- `control-m a`: insert a new cell above the current cell
- `control-m b`: insert a new cell below the current cell
