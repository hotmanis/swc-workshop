<p>
  Are you a librarian or information professional or other library staff member
  who wants to learn basic software development skills that could help you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand or build upon code created by another library or institution</li>
  <li>Optimize a workflow for converting MARC records</li>
  <li>Conduct sentiment analysis on large data sets from Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If these or other software development topics interest you,
  we are going to be running a free Software Carpentry workshop at Mozilla's office in downtown Toronto on January 13-14, 2014.
  Our two-day curriculum will include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Unix shell (but we're really teaching how to automate repetitive tasks);</li>
  <li>Git and GitHub (but we're really teaching how to use version control to track and share your work);</li>
  <li>Python or R (but we're really teaching how to grow a program in a structured, modular, testable, reusable way); and</li>
  <li>Databases (but we're really teaching the difference between structured and unstructured data).</li>
</ul>
