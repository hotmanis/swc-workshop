<p><strong>What:</strong> Our goal is to help UW-Madison researchers using computing in their
 research to become
 more productive by teaching basic computing skills like program design, version control,
 testing, and task automation. In this two-day boot camp, short tutorials will alternate with
 hands-on practical exercises. Participants will be encouraged both to help one another, and to
 apply what they have learned to their own research problems during and between sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> The course is aimed at UW-Madison graduate students, post-docs, staff, and faculty
 who have basic familiarity with programming concepts (like loops, conditionals, arrays, and
 functions), but need help translating this knowledge into practical tools to help them work
 more productively.</p>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> The syllabus for this boot camp will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>using the shell to do more in less time</li>
<li>using version control to manage and share information</li>
<li>workflow automation and scripting (with Python as example)</li>
<li>how (and how much) to test programs</li>
<li>documentation and debugging</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software 
packages installed. For full curriculum and setup instructions, please see our

Note: we'll be relying on the wireless network in the Wisconsin Instititues for Discovery.
