<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
  <a href="//software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help researchers become more productive by teaching them basic
  lab skills for computing like program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  This two-day hands-on bootcamp
  will cover basic concepts and tools; participants will be encouraged
  to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
