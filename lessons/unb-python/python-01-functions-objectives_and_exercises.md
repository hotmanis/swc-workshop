## Basic Programming Using Python: Creating Functions ##

## Objectives ##
 
-     Explain the benefits of breaking a program up into functions.
-     Define a function of a single parameter.
-     Explain what a call stack is, what a variable's scope is, and how the two concepts are related.
-     Trace values as they are passed into and returned by functions.
-     Compose function calls.


## Exercises ##




1. Create a function that returns any number to the power of 5

1. Create a function that will return a temperature in both celcius and fahrenheit


1. Calculate GC content of DNA

Because the binding strength of guanine (G) to cytosine (C) is different from the binding strength of adenine (A) to thymine (T) (and many other differences), it is often useful to know the fraction of a DNA sequence that is G's or C's. Go to the string method section of the Python documentation and find the string method that will allow you to calculate this fraction. Hint: you can use normal mathematical symbols like add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), divide (/) and parentheses to carry out calculations on numbers in Python.
